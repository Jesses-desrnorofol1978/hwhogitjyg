Oh man, I'm still kind of reeling from that tangerine  , When Life Gives You Tangerines... or is it lemons? Anyway, can't shake it off. You know when you just get out and the sticky popcorn crumbs have like, imprinted themselves onto your jeans? yeah, that. The crowd was annoyingly chatty, whispering like cicadas in summer, but they couldn't ruin it.

So the opening scene! Right? With all those tangerines rolling down the street like some kind of fruit apocalypse, reminded me of that time my combs fell out of my kit during that wedding gig and somehow it’s oddly, like, totally peaceful 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 chaos unfold. The main guy, you know, with the hair always not right, looked kind of like my cousin Jerry after he tried bleaching his own hair. I couldn't stop thinking, Dude, just let ME handle it!

> That part where she was dancing with those squirrely moves, like she was trying to swat invisible flies or maybe pretend she's karate-chopping through life. It's like when I try to cut ten heads in a row and my hands start feeling like jelly.

Halfway through, I suddenly remembered, oh! Jimmy was telling me to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  , or was it 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the  ? My mind was about as focused as shampoo foam right then, so I made a mental note... or maybe I didn't? My back was aching like after a long day snipping and styling. Seats should come with massage options. 

Anyway, that dog, Carl, with the melancholic eyebrows. How could a dog act better than half the human actors out there? I kept imagining a tiny tangerine-helmet on him, for some reason. He was stealing scenes left and right. But that scene with the bus, where they're all just standin' there philosophizing like I do when I run out of conditioner mid-appointment... mind-blown.

It’s crazy, these 𝘧𝘪𝘭𝘮𝘴 about life handing things over to you like fruit baskets make you think, without actually trying to deliver any deep, convoluted message. More like, here, have a tangerine and figure it out. Simple, yet not. Maybe a haircut could solve all their problems, I'm just saying.
